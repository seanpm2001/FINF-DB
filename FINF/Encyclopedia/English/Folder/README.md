# Folder - FINF User Encyclopedia

A folder (or [directory](/FINF/Encyclopedia/English/Directory/)) is a place in computer storage where files are stored. It is not a file.

## Allowed characters

On UNIX-Like systems, any character can be used in a folder name, except for `/`(backslash) on Windows, it is much more restrictive, not letting you use the characters `:` `;` `?` `|` `con` `aux` nul` etc.

## Hidden folders

Folders starting with `.` are hidden. You can view them by turning on hidden files on your operating system.

## In Git

_I am using GitHub as an example here. It may not reflect all of Git._

In the Git version control system, folders have to be created with a file in them. There cannot be empty folders in Git. Also, the `.` character is not allowed as the sole folder name, it has to be accompanied by another character that isn't the same.

On GitHub, you can only have 1000 items per folder. This does not include subfolders. Any additional content placed over this limit will be truncated from the web view, but still viewable when downloading the repository to your computer.

## Special folders

On most operating systems, special folders are a thing. On Linux, there is the trash can (or rubbish bin) along with various special folders, such as `desktop` `documents` `home` `pictures` `videos` `music` and more. It all depends on your Linux distribution. Under Windows, special folders include System folders, the Recycle Bin, the desktop, images, videos, documents, music, and more. No further information is available.

## Creating folders

Most GUI operating systems have an option to create folders. Simply right click and press `create folder`

To do it in a command line (Linux) the command is:

```shell
mkdir myFolderName
```

Replace `myFolderName` with the preferred name of the folder. This example also works on MacOS and bSD.

On Windows (via the command prompt) the command is:

```shell
mkdir myFolderName
```

Additionally on Windows (via PowerShell) the command is:

```powershell
md C:\myFolderName
```

## Folder icons

_The following example has been tested on Windows 10 in the past (2020) before the creator of this article switched to Linux_

On Windows, the `desktop.ini` file in a folder lets the folder display an icon. You can create one manually if you know what you are doing, or you can go to the folder, go to `properties` go to the last tab (`customize`) go to the button that says `choose icon` or `choose icon from file`

If you did `choose icon` you can scroll through icons until you find a preferred one. If you chose `choose icon from file` you will have to find a valid image, dll, or exe file to work with. Common supported image formats include `.png` `.jpg` `.ico`

_As of 2021 December 5th, the creator of this article is unsure how to change the folder icon on other operating systems._

## Item

Folders may count as a file on Linux via file properties, but it is still not considered by the system as a file.

## Viewing files and folders

In Linux, to view files and folders in the terminal, there are 3 ways of checking for files and folders.

```shell
dir
```

This will show the files and folders in one color text (typically in white) and it will also show backslashes to differentiate between files and folders.

```shell
ls
```

This will show the files and folders based on color codes.

```shell
l
```

This will show the files and folders based on color codes, but will also show backslashes to differentiate between files anf folders.
