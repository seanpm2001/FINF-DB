# Older project

## File extension reference

There was an older project of mine that has a similarity to this project. I have tried in the past to make a collection of as many file extensions as possible, originally not to document them, but to view their icons. This project serves that as its second purpose. The original had over 1700 file formats, I hope to eventually come close to that here.

The original program was very bloated, as I just copied random application and system files. It was over 4 gigabytes in size. I still have it somewhere, but there is no point in uploading it yet.

**This article needs improvement**
