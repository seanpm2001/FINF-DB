# TODO FINF-DB

There is still a lot that needs to be improved on for this project. I will go over some entries here:

## Pseudo extensions

Pseudo extensions, .OSX, .WIN32 .SOLARIS .DEBIAN .LINUX .:.:.eTc.:.:.

## Problems with existing file info services

Mention a problem with current file services: so many extensions not present, some extensions have a top definition of "Spyware/Ransomware" when that is not what they are (example: MAKEFILE was recognized as Ransomware)

## Stylesheets

Some starter stylesheets that need to be added

<!--Stylesheets {!-->

```
BasicHTML_LightMode.css
BasicHTML_LightMode.less
BasicHTML_DarkMode.css
BasicHTML_DarkMode.less
BasicNavBar.css
BasicNarBar.less
```

<!--}!-->
